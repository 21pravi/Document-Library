# Document-Library
Pravi Library is a simple web-based application that allows users to manage their personal book collection. Users can add books by entering the title, author, number of pages, and indicating whether the book has been read or not. The app dynamically displays the collection with options to toggle the "Read" status or remove a book from the list.
